              <p class="content">The Atari CX40 single-button, digital joystick was the first widely used cross-platform game controller. The original CX10 was released with the Atari Video Computer System (later renamed the Atari 2600) in 1977 and
                became the primary input device for most games on the platform. The CX10 was replaced after a year by the simpler and less expensive CX40. The addition of the Atari joystick port to other platforms cemented its popularity. It was the
                standard for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers and was compatible with the VIC-20, Commodore 64, MSX, and later the Atari ST and Amiga. Third-party adapters allowed it to be used on other systems, such as the Apple II. The CX40
                was so popular during its run that it became as iconic to Atari as the company's "Fuji" logo; it remains a common staple in video game iconography to this day, and is commonly referred to as the symbol of 1980s video game system
                design. The CX40 has been called "the pinnacle of home entertainment controllers in its day", and remains a staple of industrial design discussions.

              <p class="content">A D-pad (short for directional pad) is a flat, usually thumb-operated, usually digital, four-way directional control with one button on each point, found on nearly all modern video game console gamepads. Like early
                video game joysticks, the directions provided on the D-pad buttons can be used, with no intermediate values. However, combinations of two directions (up and left, for example) do provide diagonals and many modern D-pads can be used to
                provide eight-directional input if appropriate. D-pads have appeared on other kinds of electronic equipment, remote controls calculators, smartphones, and car stereos. The game controller used for both the NES and the Famicom features
                an oblong brick-like design with a simple four button layout: two round buttons labeled "A" and "B", a "START" button, and a "SELECT" button. Additionally, the controllers utilize the cross-shaped joypad, designed by Nintendo, to
                replace the bulkier joysticks on earlier gaming consoles' controllers.

              <p class="content">The DualShock is a line of gamepads with vibration-feedback and analog controls developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation systems. The DualShock was introduced in Japan in November 1997 and
                launched in the North American market in May 1998. First introduced as a secondary peripheral for the original PlayStation, an updated version of the PlayStation console included the controller. Sony subsequently phased out the
                digital controller that was originally included with the console, as well as the Sony Dual Analog Controller. As of 2008, over 28 million DualShock controllers have been sold under the brand's name, excluding bundled controllers.

              <p class="content">The basic design of a generic joystick is quite simple. For a joystick to function, it merely needs to have four different switches, each corresponding to a different direction. When the stick is moved in a particular
                direction, a tiny metal disc makes a connection with the circuit board turning the switch on and generating an electrical signal that indicates that the joystick was moved in a particular direction.The invention of the first joystick
                that consisted of a central shaft and a pivotal point is credited to Stephen D. Bristow. By 1978, when Bristow received the patent for the Atari joystick, there were many other designs for joysticks. In part, this was due to the
                simplicity with which a crude joystick can be made as mentioned above. What separated the Atari joystick was that it consisted of a central shaft that pivoted to make the connections to give the five directions (up, down, left, and
                right) and a fire button. In 1977, Atari offered the Atari joystick along with the de facto paddle controller for Pong with its Atari 2600 Video Computer System (VCS), thereby giving birth to the first joystick on a video game
                console.

              <p class="content">Nintendo branched into producing a series of coin-operated arcade
                games, including Donkey Kong. While making coin-op games, Yamauchi was
                inspired by the home computer systems that were emerging and the potential
                of a computer system disguised as a toy – a so called Trojan Horse that could
                penetrate the home market. While most machines on the market at the time cost
                between $200 to $350, Yamauchi wanted a system less than $75, and had to be
                better with more features than all the other systems. To save money on selling what is
                essentially a computer, all of the frills were eliminated including the keyboard, the
                modem, and the disk drive. Removing the keyboard meant that there needed to be another
                way for the player to communicate with this computer. The solution to this problem
                became the Nintendo controller featuring two buttons on the right controller with a
                directional pad. With the inclusion of the NES controller, the directional pad was firmly
                established in the history of video game consoles.

              <p class="content">Sony’s PlayStation Dual Shock! The controller
                components of the directional pad and the joystick have been combined into one
                controller. Although derived from the same histories, the variation in the directional pad
                and the joystick offered different control options and tradeoffs in different situations. For
                example, even though the joystick allowed greater range of motion, the early joystick
                were more prone to damage compared to the directional pad. The dual shock controller
                on the PlayStation combined the directional pad, two joysticks, and a plethora of buttons
                (14 buttons to be exact, including the directional pad). Unlike the original Atari digital
                joystick, the joysticks on the dual shock controller were analog. Analog joysticks
                descended from digital joysticks and differed in that two potentiometers – similar to the
                ones used on the original Pong controllers – were attached to the joystick to measure the
                amount of the joystick has moved in the horizontal and the vertical directions so that the
                switches were not simply on and off, but depended on how far the joystick was moved.
                Further, these joysticks were also force feedback, which meant that two motors controlled
                by a processor were added to each joystick to make the stick move in a particular
                direction when the need arose.
